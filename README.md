# Python-Experiments
This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI8133, *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

# Plan
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample sata file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook that will interact with the file.
